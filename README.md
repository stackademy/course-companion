## Code education for the real world

With [Stackademy](http://stackademy.com), we teach ambitious students how to plan, build and deploy web applications from start to finish using Ruby on Rails and additional technologies.

This is our road map as we progress through 12 weeks of full-time training. If you would like to learn more, [visit us](http://stackademy.com), reach out via [email](mailto:hello@stackademy.com) or [apply directly](http://stackademy.com/apply).
