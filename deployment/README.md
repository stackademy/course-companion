# Server deployment

## Goals
Instead of leaving your laptop running on "rails s" for all eternity, you can also set up a computer in the cloudâ„¢ to run your applications and serve up websites independently.  
And essentially, that is exactly what a web server is at its core, so we need to 
* set up an operating system and 
* install the tools we use on the laptop from Ruby to git. 
* Additionally, we want to install a suitable web server like Apache or nginx ('engine x') to accept incoming connections.  

Here we go!
